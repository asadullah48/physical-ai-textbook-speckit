# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook for **Panaversity's Physical AI course**. This 13-week curriculum covers the foundations of embodied intelligence, robot operating systems, simulation environments, and cutting-edge AI systems for humanoid robotics.

## Course Overview

Physical AI represents the intersection of artificial intelligence with the physical world. Unlike purely digital AI systems, physical AI must navigate real-world constraints: physics, uncertainty, and real-time decision-making.

This textbook is organized into **5 modules**:

### Module 1: Introduction to Physical AI (Weeks 1-2)
Foundations of embodied intelligence, sensor systems (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs), and the advantages of humanoid form factors.

### Module 2: ROS 2 Fundamentals (Weeks 3-5)
Robot Operating System 2 concepts including nodes, topics, services, actions, and URDF for humanoid robots.

### Module 3: Simulation Environments (Weeks 6-7)
Gazebo physics simulation, Unity-based rendering, and sensor simulation for safe robot development.

### Module 4: NVIDIA Isaac Platform (Weeks 8-10)
Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS with Visual SLAM, and Nav2 path planning for bipedal locomotion.

### Module 5: Vision-Language-Action Systems (Weeks 11-13)
Voice-to-action pipelines, LLM-based cognitive planning, and a capstone project for autonomous humanoid behavior.
